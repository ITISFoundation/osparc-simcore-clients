# Development notes

These notes are intended for people who want to contribute to the development of this repository.

The different clients for the oSPARC public API are generated using the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator)-tool.
*The generated files should not be changed manually!*
Instead proposed changes should be implemented directly on the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator)-repository.
See also [templates](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/templating) and [customization](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/customization).

## Workflow

See the different `clients/<language>/README.md` for the workflows for generating the different clients. Here is the workflow which all clients have in common:

- To generate a client one needs two "ingredients":
    1. The openapi specification which is a json file located in `api/openapi.json`. This generated in [osparc-simcore](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/tree/master/services/api-server) and then moved here.
    2. The [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator)-tool. The exact docker image of this tool to use is specifies in `scripts/common.Makefile`.

## Documentation

Each client (corresponding to a directory `clients/<language>`) should have a make recipy called `install-doc` which installs packages needed to generate the documentation for that client, as well as a make recipe `docs` which generates the documentation. All of these recipes are called from the root's `docs` recipe, which is what is called when the website is published.
