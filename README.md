# NOTES

For the moment, we have to apply some changes manually until we use [templates](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/templating) or [customization](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/customization)

### Workflow

- update OAS -> ``api/openapi.json``
- generate client ``make python-client``
- generate documentation ``make postprocess-docs``
