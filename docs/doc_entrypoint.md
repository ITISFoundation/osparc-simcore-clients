<h1 align="center">oSPARC-Simcore clients</h1>

[o²S²PARC](https://sparc.science/resources/4LkLiH5s4FV0LVJd3htsvH) is
an open, cloud-based platform for the development, execution and sharing of
computational models, simulations, and data analysis pipelines, and the
presentation of results.

This site documents clients for interacting with o²S²PARC programmatically.

Please first choose the version of the client you are using. Note that the API (and hence tutorials) does not change with patches, meaning if you are using client version, say 0.3.2, then you can use the tutorials associated with version 0.3.0.
  * Python API:
    * [v0.5.0](clients/python/docs/v0.5.0/README.md)
    * [v0.6.0](clients/python/docs/v0.6.0/README.md)

We're committed to continually expanding and refining our platform.
Stay tuned for future updates and additional API client offerings.
